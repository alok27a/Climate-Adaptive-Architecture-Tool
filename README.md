# New Orleans Climate-Adaptive Architecture Tool ðŸŒŠ

A prototype application to help architects design flood-resilient buildings in New Orleans, forecasting their performance against future climate conditions and providing actionable, AI-powered adaptation strategies.

---

## Project Overview

New Orleans faces increasing flood risks due to sea level rise and land subsidence. This tool acts as a "future-proofing calculator" for architects, allowing them to simulate how their building designs will perform under projected climate changes through 2055, and receive data-driven recommendations for enhanced resilience.

## Core Features & How It Works 

The tool takes your building's design choices (foundation type, elevation, materials, and flood mitigation features) as input. It then processes this information through a series of calculations and an integrated AI to provide four key outputs:

### 1. Resilience Score

- **What it is:** A percentage from 0% to 100%, indicating how well your building design is expected to withstand future flooding. A higher score means greater resilience. This score is calculated for each year in the future timeline.
- **How it's done:**
  - **Starts at Zero:** Every calculation for a specific year begins with a score of 0.
  - **Foundation & Elevation:** Your chosen foundation type (e.g., pilings vs. slab-on-grade) and how high your building's lowest floor is (its elevation) are the biggest factors. Being significantly above the projected flood level earns major positive points, while being below incurs penalties.
  - **Materials:** Flood-resistant materials (e.g., cement board, closed-cell foam) add points, especially if the building is projected to be wet. Vulnerable materials (e.g., standard drywall, carpet) subtract points.
  - **Mitigation Features:** Specific flood protection elements (e.g., flood vents, elevated mechanical systems, backflow valves, site drainage) add further points.
  - **Final Score:** All these impacts are added up, and the total is capped between 0% and 100%.

| 2050 | 14â€“18 inches *(Gulf Coast specific)*                                   | Tropical storms/hurricanes more intense.                  | NOAA                    |
| 2055 | 19â€“23 inches *(Extrapolated High-End)*                                 | Continued increase in frequency and intensity.            | Extrapolated from NOAA  |

### 2. Performance Timeline 

- **What it is:** A step-by-step forecast showing your building's resilience score and expected flood impact year by year (every 5 years) through 2055.
- **How it's done:**
  - The tool calculates the **Projected Future Flood Level** for each specific year. This level considers scientific estimates of sea level rise and local land sinking for New Orleans under a chosen climate scenario (defaulting to "Intermediate-High").
  - For each year, it applies the "Resilience Score" calculation using that year's projected flood level.
  - It also determines the **Flood Depth (in):** how many inches of water (if any) are projected to be above your building's lowest floor in that year.

### 3. Adaptive Recommendations *(Smart Advice from an AI Architect)*

- **What it is:** A list of specific, practical, and actionable suggestions to improve your building's flood resilience and "future-proof" it over the long term. These come from an Artificial Intelligence model.
- **How it's done:**
  - The tool compiles all your building's initial design details and its complete "Performance Timeline."
  - It sends this information as a detailed query to an external Large Language Model (LLM), like OpenAI's ChatGPT.
  - Acting as an expert architect, the LLM analyzes the current design and its future performance and generates relevant recommendations covering areas like structural enhancements, advanced materials, and maintenance strategies.

### 4. Cost-Benefit Analysis

- **What it is:** An estimation of the potential costs of implementing the recommended adaptive measures versus the financial benefits (savings) you might gain over the 30-year projection.
- **How it's done:**
  - **Upfront Cost Estimate:**
    - For each adaptive recommendation from the AI, the tool tries to match it to a predefined list of common mitigation "cost items" (e.g., "House Elevation," "Add Flood Vents").
    - It then adds the average estimated cost for each matched item to a running total. For very broad recommendations, it uses a general manual estimate.
  - **Long-Term Savings Estimate:**
    - **Avoided Damage Costs:** If the original building design was projected to get flooded, the tool estimates savings from not having to fix future damages. (If your original design is already dry, this saving is zero).
    - **Insurance Premium Reduction:** Flood-resilient features can lower flood insurance premiums. The tool estimates potential annual percentage reductions and projects these savings over 30 years.
  - **Overall ROI Description:** It compares total Upfront Cost vs. Long-Term Savings to summarize the net financial outcome (net benefit or cost).

## Underlying Data & Methodology

The data used in this prototype is simulated but rigorously informed by scientific and industry sources. Itâ€™s intended to demonstrate the toolâ€™s capabilities, not provide real-time, address-specific predictions.

### Primary Data Basis:
- **Climate Projections:** NOAA Sea Level Rise Technical Reports (e.g., 2022 Report), plus New Orleans-specific land subsidence research.
- **Resilient Design Features:** FEMA NFIP Technical Bulletins (e.g., TB 2), and general architectural flood-resistant best practices.
- **Cost & Benefit Data:** Construction cost estimators, typical flood repair cost studies, and NFIP Risk Rating 2.0 (e.g., Florida Sea Grant on RR2.0).
